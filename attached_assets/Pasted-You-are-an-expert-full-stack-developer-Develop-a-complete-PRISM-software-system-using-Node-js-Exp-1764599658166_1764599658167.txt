You are an expert full-stack developer.
Develop a complete PRISM software system using Node.js + Express backend, React frontend, and strictly MySQL Workbench database.
DO NOT use PostgreSQL, SQLite or any other DB.
Use the following real MySQL credentials exactly:

MYSQL_HOST=127.0.0.1  
MYSQL_USER=root  
MYSQL_PASSWORD=12345  
MYSQL_DATABASE=prism


Use the mysql2/promise library for MySQL connection.

✅ 1. PROJECT STRUCTURE

Create the following backend structure:

/backend
  /config/db.js
  /controllers/*.js
  /routes/*.js
  /models/*.js
  /middleware/auth.js
  server.js
/frontend
  src/
    pages/
    components/
    layouts/
    services/api.js

✅ 2. DATABASE — CREATE ALL TABLES (MySQL)

Generate full SQL schema and automatically write .sql file containing:

User Tables

users (username, password, security_pin, role: admin / gst / non-gst)

Customer Master

customers

customer_contacts (multiple contact persons)

Project Master

projects (project type Movie, Serial, Web Series, Ad, Teaser, Trilogy)

Room Master

rooms (type: Sound, Music, VFX, Client Office, etc.)

Editor Master

editors (type, name, join date, leave date, active, ignore_conflict)

Booking

bookings

booking_logs

Booking fields must include:
(cancel flag, room type, room, customer, project, contact person, editor, from time, to time, actual times, break hours, total hours, status = Planning / Tentative / Confirmed)

Leaves

editor_leaves

Chalan

chalan

chalan_items

chalan_revised

Reports

No separate tables needed, queries only.

✅ 3. BACKEND REQUIREMENTS

Create full CRUD API for:

Masters

Customer (CRUD + multiple contacts)

Project (CRUD + dynamic project types)

Room (CRUD)

Editor (CRUD)

User (CRUD + role assignment)

Operations

Booking (full CRUD + conflict check logic)

Booking cancellation (store reason + mark uneditable)

Booking repeat functionality (repeat booking for multiple days)

Ignore conflict support (allow duplicate booking only if ignore flag is set)

Booking logs (store every edit with timestamp)

Leaves

Editor leave CRUD

Chalan

Create chalan

Revise chalan

Mark chalan/invoice flags on projects

Print format API

Reports APIs

Conflict Report

Booking Report

Editor Report (with printable format)

Chalan Report

User Rights

Role-based access control

Admin has full access

GST user only sees billing

Non-GST only sees non-gst billing

✅ 4. MODERN UI REQUIREMENTS (React)

Use a clean, modern, dashboard UI:

Global Design:

Sidebar navigation (Operations, Masters, Reports, Utility, Windows, Exit)

Topbar (username, date selector, company selector)

Responsive design

Use TailwindCSS or Material UI

Booking UI:

Drag-and-drop monthly calendar

Hover to view booking logs

Color codes:

Cancelled = Red

Planning = Blue

Tentative = Yellow

Confirmed = Green

Form popup with all fields

Checkbox: hide cancelled bookings

Chalan UI:

Print preview page

Export PDF/Excel

Editable revision page

Reports UI:

Filters on top

Export to Excel / CSV

Sortable table columns

Search inside columns

✅ 5. CONNECT FRONTEND TO BACKEND

Create /frontend/src/services/api.js with Axios:

createCustomer(), getCustomers(), etc.

createBooking(), repeatBooking(), cancelBooking(), etc.

getConflictReport(), getEditorReport(), etc.

✅ 6. IMPORTANT CONDITIONS

Replit MUST NOT replace MySQL with PostgreSQL.

Use MySQL Workbench local DB.

Do not use Prisma, Sequelize, or ORMs. Use raw SQL or mysql2.

Generate all CRUD operations.

Generate sample seed data.

Ensure error handling + validation.

Write complete API documentation.

✅ 7. DELIVERABLE OUTPUT FROM REPLIT

Replit must generate:

Backend

✔ Complete Node.js Express API
✔ MySQL connection
✔ CRUD controllers
✔ Routes
✔ Auth middleware
✔ SQL Schema file
✔ Conflict booking algorithm
✔ Chalan generation logic
✔ Report APIs

Frontend

✔ Full React app
✔ Dashboard UI
✔ Modern booking calendar
✔ CRUD pages for all masters
✔ Reports UI + Export
✔ Chalan print format

🚀 Final Instruction

Build the FULL WORKING PRISM SOFTWARE exactly as per the requirement document.
Focus on clean code, modular structure, and production-ready UI.
